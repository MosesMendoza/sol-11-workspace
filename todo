#Explore tools to introspect binaries and libraries

Explore creating a sol11 zone on mundilfari for testing libraries and binaries

Explore tools ( how do I introspect libraries and binaries? )

1 look at zone, get IP up, see if can work externally

2 get augeas to zone, see if works

3 if no work, fix

4 if works, begin looking at ent-dist work
  * move to solaris 11 sources file
  * automation for manifest erb
  * local/global transforms?
  * fork at tar ball, and package from tarball
